# ESE5190 Lab 2B Part 04 - Slow Motion

## Lab 2B - Amogh Gajare worked with Saurabh Parulekar


By adding multipliers and divider variables to delay between recording values, we can control the speed. We have also givena  provision so that the user can select the color of LED while playing the recording.

The speeds user can select are Normal playback, 2x faster playback, 4x faster playback, 2x slower playback, 4x slower playback and can select Red, Blue or Green as colors.

Here, we have played the same recording first with red color at normal speed and second time at 4x faster speed in blue color.
